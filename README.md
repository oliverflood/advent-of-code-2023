# README
These are my solutions to problems from [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)!

## About
I decided to do this year in Python since I wanted a different experience from the messy C++ code of 2022 and 2021. Worked out great!
Some of the later solutions aren't polished since they were a bit rushed :P.
I left my graph for day 20 in since I think it's quite nice. 
Happy New Years! 2024 is here!
